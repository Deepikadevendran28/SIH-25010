## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution

* A Pocket Agri-Scientist + Marketplace + Weather Guard, all inside a farmer’s phone.
* Every farmer creates a digital twin of their farm (soil, land size, water availability).
* “Click & Cure” Plant Doctor

## Technical Approach
* AI/ML Models: Crop recommendation, disease prediction, market trend analysis.

* Computer Vision (CNN): For pest/disease detection.

* IoT + Satellite: Soil, water, and weather monitoring.

* Cloud + Edge Computing: Offline-first access (data syncs when internet available).

* Languages & Voice AI: NLP for farmer queries in regional dialects.


## Feasibility and Viability
* Technical Feasibility:

IoT sensors for soil moisture, pH, and temperature are widely available and affordable.

Mobile app development is feasible with Android/iOS platforms; SMS alerts cover non-smartphone users. 

* Operational Feasibility:
Farmers can be trained through workshops, local agriculture extension centers, and demonstration farms.

Offline functionality ensures usability in areas with poor internet connectivity.

Viability:
* India has over 120 million small and marginal farmers, a large potential user base.

* Early detection of diseases and pests reduces crop loss, ensuring long-term viability.

* Revenue can be generated via subscription models, government partnerships, or agro-market tie-ups.


Economic Feasibility:

* Initial investment in IoT devices and app development can be offset by increased yield and reduced input costs.

* Government support and agricultural grants can further reduce implementation costs.




## Impact and Benefits
* 30–40% higher yield with right crop choices & pest management.

* 20–25% input savings (water, fertilizer, pesticides).

* Income boost via smart market linkages.

* Climate resilience with predictive weather-based advisories.

* Water-efficient irrigation practices conserve water resources.

* Improves food security and reduces rural poverty.



## Research and References


* Deep learning models (CNNs) have been used successfully for crop disease detection with >90% accuracy.

* Yield prediction using historical weather and soil data improves planning.
